In honors chemistry, our primary objective is to grow our science skills, as outlined in the OES science learning outcomes, through the study of the fundamental building blocks of our physical world. These skills will be developed through the inquiry-based investigations of traditional first-year chemistry content, as well as the independent Science Research Project. Chemistry is a unique and powerful lens through which to see the world. It is my hope that through this course you will learn to use chemistry as a problem solving tool for real-life situations, and be prepared to excel in collegiate-level chemistry.
George, your steady scores reflect a sound understanding of the course's concepts and skills, with the ability to apply these concepts in different situations and occasionally push the envelope with your ideas. Your analytical and evaluative skills are evident. Your communication, both in writing and speech, showcases well-developed ideas that are clearly and concisely expressed, with a good amount of supporting evidence. Most of the learning indicators for the course have been met by you with consistency.
