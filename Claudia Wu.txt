In honors chemistry, our primary objective is to grow our science skills, as outlined in the OES science learning outcomes, through the study of the fundamental building blocks of our physical world. These skills will be developed through the inquiry-based investigations of traditional first-year chemistry content, as well as the independent Science Research Project. Chemistry is a unique and powerful lens through which to see the world. It is my hope that through this course you will learn to use chemistry as a problem solving tool for real-life situations, and be prepared to excel in collegiate-level chemistry.
Claudia, your scores have consistently indicated that you understand the course's concepts and skills well, and you are able to apply them effectively in various circumstances, at times even advancing the ideas further. You demonstrate good analytical and evaluative capabilities. Your ability to communicate, both orally and in writing, features well-constructed ideas that are clearly articulated and adequately supported by evidence. You have reliably and consistently met most of the learning objectives for the course.
