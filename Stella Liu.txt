In honors chemistry, our primary objective is to grow our science skills, as outlined in the OES science learning outcomes, through the study of the fundamental building blocks of our physical world. These skills will be developed through the inquiry-based investigations of traditional first-year chemistry content, as well as the independent Science Research Project. Chemistry is a unique and powerful lens through which to see the world. It is my hope that through this course you will learn to use chemistry as a problem solving tool for real-life situations, and be prepared to excel in collegiate-level chemistry.
Throughout the course, your assessment scores have been outstanding, signaling your comprehensive understanding and your adeptness at applying the material in new ways. You've pushed the boundaries of the course content with your insightful evaluations and analyses. Your communication skills are top-notch, with each idea being well-supported, clearly delivered, and articulated using the specific vocabulary of the subject. It's clear you've consistently met and applied the course learning indicators to a high standard.
