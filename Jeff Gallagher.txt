In honors chemistry, our primary objective is to grow our science skills, as outlined in the OES science learning outcomes, through the study of the fundamental building blocks of our physical world. These skills will be developed through the inquiry-based investigations of traditional first-year chemistry content, as well as the independent Science Research Project. Chemistry is a unique and powerful lens through which to see the world. It is my hope that through this course you will learn to use chemistry as a problem solving tool for real-life situations, and be prepared to excel in collegiate-level chemistry.
Jeff, your consistent assessment results show that you have an adequate grasp of the course's concepts and skills. You are able to apply these concepts and skills suitably in familiar situations, though extending these applications to new contexts beyond the classroom examples has not been demonstrated. Your evaluation and analysis skills are basic but developing. In terms of communication, your verbal and written skills present satisfactory ideas, backed by some evidence, and are somewhat clear. You have fully met at least half of the learning indicators, with the remainder being partially met.
